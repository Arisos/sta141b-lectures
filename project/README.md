# STA141B Final project

In this final project, you are going to write a shiny application to demonstrate the techniques that you learn in this course. You will need to obtain some data from the web.

Here is a list of public APIs for your reference: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
You are not limited to the APIs listed there, however, you are advised to focus on APIs with no authentication or using API keys.

## Requirements

- the application should be deployed to shinyapps.io or google cloud run
- the source code should be uploaded to github and share to the public.

## Grading criterion

Your grade will be determined based on the following criterion.

- (30%) novelty and practicalness
    - Is it useful? It would be very boring if you built an application which counts the number of seconds since big bang.
    - Is it user friendly. Of course , our course is not about software design but you do want to make sure that your app is not too hard to navigate.
- (30%) Statistical correctness. 
    - Make sure that your app is statistically sensible (if it is relevant).
    You do not want to produce anything that are statistical wrong, for example, using a piechart to show a quantitative variable.
    - For the statistical analyses, make sure the analyses were correctly done.
- (40%) coding
    - Is it usable? Bugs?
    - Is the code efficient?
    - Coding style. You want your code to be clean and well documented. Just imagine another people will be taking charge of the maintenance of your app. (Hint: make use of `styler`)
